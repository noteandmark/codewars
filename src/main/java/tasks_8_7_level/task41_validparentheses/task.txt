Constraints

0 <= length of input <= 100

    All inputs will be strings, consisting only of characters ( and ).
    Empty strings are considered balanced (and therefore valid), and will be tested.
    For languages with mutable strings, the inputs should not be mutated.


Protip: If you are trying to figure out why a string of parentheses is invalid,
paste the parentheses into the code editor, and let the code highlighting show you!
