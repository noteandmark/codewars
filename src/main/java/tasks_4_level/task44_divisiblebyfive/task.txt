Define a regular expression which tests if a given string representing a binary number is divisible by 5.
Examples:

// 5 divisible by 5
DivisibleByFive.pattern().matcher('101').matches() == true

// 135 divisible by 5
DivisibleByFive.pattern().matcher('10000111').matches() == true

// 666 not divisible by 5
DivisibleByFive.pattern().matcher('0000001010011010').matches() == false

Note:

This can be solved by creating a Finite State Machine that evaluates if a string representing a number in binary base is divisible by given number.
